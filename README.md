## Book Search Engine

## Description
The Book Search Engine app is designed to allow users to search for books using the Google Books API. This project aims to provide a personalized experience for users, allowing them to save their book searches to the backend. The app is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and utilizes a RESTful API, which is refactored into a GraphQL API using Apollo Server to improve flexibility and performance in handling user requests.

This project demonstrates how to personalize user data and evolve web applications by incorporating modern technologies like GraphQL, Apollo, and MongoDB Atlas, while maintaining a smooth and responsive user experience.
